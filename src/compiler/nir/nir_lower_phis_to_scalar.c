/**
 * Determines if the given phi node should be lowered.  The only phi nodes
 * we will scalarize at the moment are those where all of the sources are
 * scalarizable, unless lower_all is set.
 *
 * The reason for this comes down to coalescing.  Since phi sources can't
 * swizzle, swizzles on phis have to be resolved by inserting a mov right
 * before the phi.  The choice then becomes between movs to pick off
 * components for a scalar phi or potentially movs to recombine components
 * for a vector phi.  The problem is that the movs generated to pick off
 * the components are almost uncoalescable.  We can't coalesce them in NIR
 * because we need them to pick off components and we can't coalesce them
 * in the backend because the source register is a vector and the
 * destination is a scalar that may be used at other places in the program.
 * On the other hand, if we have a bunch of scalars going into a vector
 * phi, the situation is much better.  In this case, if the SSA def is
 * generated in the predecessor block to the corresponding phi source, the
 * backend code will be an ALU op into a temporary and then a mov into the
 * given vector component;  this move can almost certainly be coalesced
 * away.
